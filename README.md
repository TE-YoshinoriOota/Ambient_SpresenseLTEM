Sony Spresense is a single board computer integrated with a positioning functionality that has GPS, GLONASS and QZSS (みちびき) that enables to get a precise position.
["Ambient"](https://ambidata.io/) is an IoT cloud service to make IoT data to be visualized. And it is able to put the data on maps easily when you add the position information.
The example skech in this library can make you have a hint to make an application to gether the data and its position data using Sony Spresense 
and and send them to the Ambient service. The example sketches in this library can make you get a hint to make an application to collect and send the data and its position data using Sony Spresense.
